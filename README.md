## Agentic AI

**Agentic AI** refers to AI systems that autonomously make decisions, take actions, and pursue goals with minimal human supervision. These systems integrate **large language models (LLMs)** with **reasoning and planning capabilities** to complete complex tasks efficiently.

## CrewAI Framework

**CrewAI** is a Python-based framework designed for building and orchestrating **multi-agent AI systems**. It enables developers to define **agents**, assign **tasks**, and create structured workflows for **collaborative AI automation**.

### Agents

An **Agent** in CrewAI is an autonomous entity that can process tasks, interact with other agents, and execute actions.

### Tasks

**Tasks** define what an agent needs to do. They are modular and can be assigned to different agents to perform **collaborative AI workflows**.

### Components and Arguments

CrewAI offers different components, each with specific arguments:

- **Agent**
  - `name`: The identifier for the agent.
  - `role`: Defines the agent's function.
  - `tools`: Specifies external tools the agent can use.

- **Task**
  - `description`: A summary of the task.
  - `agent`: The agent responsible for execution.
  - `input_data`: The data required for the task.

## UV Package Manager

**UV** is a fast, **next-generation Python package manager** built as an alternative to **pip** and **venv**. It offers improved performance, deterministic dependency resolution, and compatibility with existing package repositories.

## LangChain and LangGraph

### LangChain

**LangChain** is an open-source framework designed to build applications powered by **LLMs (Large Language Models)**. It simplifies **prompt engineering, memory handling, API calls, and multi-agent integration**.

#### Key Features:
- **Chains**: Sequences of LLM calls with logic.
- **Memory**: Persistent and context-aware interactions.
- **Agents**: AI-driven decision-makers that use tools.
- **Retrieval**: Connecting LLMs with structured/unstructured data.
- **Integrations**: Works with OpenAI, Hugging Face, and many APIs.

LangChain is used to create **intelligent chatbots, autonomous research agents, and AI-powered search engines**.

### LangGraph

**LangGraph** is a **stateful multi-agent framework** built by LangChain Inc. It extends LangChain by **providing graph-based workflows**, allowing **agents to interact, share memory, and make decisions collectively**.

#### Key Features:
- **Graph-based execution**: Agents operate in a structured workflow.
- **Stateful interactions**: AI agents share memory over time.
- **Multi-agent collaboration**: Different AI agents communicate and work together.
- **Dynamic branching**: The workflow adapts based on responses.

LangGraph is useful for **multi-agent AI systems, workflow automation, and decision-making AI applications**.
